Use conventional commit message formats. For example:
- chore: miscellaneous changes: build process, dependencies, tool files, etc.
- docs: changes in documentation
- feat: add new feature
- fix: fix a bug
- enhance: changes that improve or extend existing features
- refactor: refactor code without changing its behavior
- test: add or changes in tests
